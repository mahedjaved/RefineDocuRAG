# Project Description

## Motivation

* The project is motivated by the need to improve the quality of generated code by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs).
* In industry applications of RAG based querying system, the quality of the generated answer to query is improved via change of backend model.
* Task switching is expensive if purely relying on model switching.
* This repository aims to provide a solution of rag-refinement using machine learning techniques to improve the quality of generated answers.

## Problem Statement

* The problem statement is to develop a machine learning model that can improve the quality of generated answers to queries in a RAG based querying system.

## Methodology

* A simple implementation of a rag is used in this project.
* Demo repo available at : https://github.com/mahedjaved/ReactRAGpdf
* It is a Java-Spring-React based implementation of a rag based querying system.
* This codebase will be improved step-by-step as the project progresses.

# Record of Improvement

* The project will be improved step-by-step as the project progresses.
* The record of improvement will be documented in this section.
